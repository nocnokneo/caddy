This software is written for the Atmel Atmega32 processor using the free
gcc-avr C compiler. It has been tested on the ERE EMBMega32 developement board
from ERE (http://ere.co.th) but should run on any Atmega32 processor, although
it will be useless without the right peripherals connected to the proper pins
on the Atmega chip.

TODO: Some high-level information about what our program does and how
to configure, compile, load, and run on the chip.
