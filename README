This software is written for the Atmel Atmega32 processor using the
free gcc-avr C compiler. It has been tested on the Embega developement
board from ERE (http://ere.co.th) but should run on any Atmega32
processor, although it will be pretty useless without the right
peripherals connected to the proper pins on the Atmega chip :)

* Put some high-level information about what our program does and how
to configure, compile, load, and run on the chip.
