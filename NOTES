Gameday Checklist
-----------------
This is a "50 point checklist" of everything that we need to triple check before each run on the big day.

* Wheel encoders are mounted well, and giving good readings
* Wire bundle to CMUcam2 is adjusted vertically to put as little strain on the tilting and panning action as possible.
* Lift action moves smoothly
* Casters roll and rotate smoothly
* Batteries are fully charged (borrow charger from Garran)
* Power on, then press reset.
* Remove while(1) from NAK case.
* Grease: tilt axis, lift, spring
* Check break-beam pot

2005-02-26:trjones: I setup the directory stucture using conventions
that it seems like just about all open source projects use. 'src' is
for all *.c and *.h files. 'bin' is where the Makefile will put all
*.o and *.hex output files. 'doc' really doesn't have much purpose for
us that I can see since we're not going to be producing any kind of
extensive documentation. I removed the gant stuff since it doesn't
really belong in a cvs repository. cvs can be funky about folders so
keep the directory structure within each folder flat (i.e. no more
folders should be created).
